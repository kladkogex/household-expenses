# Household expenses
This project is an experiment to analyze my bank transactions and automatically categorize them using a machine learning model.
You can download this project and try it at your own risk with your own model.

## Quickstart
To get the project running, make sure that you follow these simple steps. All steps should be performed from the root folder.

1. Run `sbt clean compile` to compile the application
2. Run `docker-compose up` to get the kafka broker up and running
3. Run `sbt run` to start the application

Open up a browser to `http://localhost:9000/` and start using the application.

## Setup for local development
To work on the code you need the following tools:

1. Docker-compose + Docker
2. SBT (Scala Build Tool)
3. Your favorite IDE



## Development status
As with most hobby projects, this is a work in progress and I don't have a lot of time. So keep that in mind.
Be that as it may, you are welcome to drop issues or pull requests on this project.
